# Titipat Curriculum Vitae

LaTeX files for Curriculum Vitae features [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and Thai font for Thai CV.
The folders are in the following structures:

- `en/` for Titipat's English CV
- `th/` for Titipat's Thai CV
- `pdf/` for compiled PDF files

## Using this with OverLeaf

- Fork this repository
- Select `New Project`, then choose `Import from Github`, and select repository name (in this case `titipat_cv`)
- Now when you are in the project, select `Menu` (Top left corner) and change compiler to `XeLaTex`
- Select `resume.tex` in `en` (for English CV) or `resume.tex` in `th` (for Thai CV) then run `Compile`

**Note**: You may experience a cursor misalignment for Thai text on Overleaf editor.
